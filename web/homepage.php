	<h1>Intro</h1>
	<div class="maintext"><p>My name is Michael Garrard. I'm a Software Engineering student at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy music, games, anime, and spending time with my friends and family. I served a 2-year proselyting mission in Michigan, and loved it. I have one brother, one sister, and about 15 guitars. I enjoy online competitive games, as well as single-player horror games. They really get my heart racing. Below is a picture of me (I'm second from the right) with my mom, dad, brother, and sister-in-law.</p>
