	<div class="maintext"><p>My biggest passion is composing music. Specifically rock music. I'd personally love to make a career out of music, but if that doesn't allow me to support a family, I would like to work a software job. Which is why I'm studying software engineering. I do feel that I'd enjoy a coding job as well. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/michaelgarrard/dawn">Here</a> is a link to my most recently uploaded recording. I am in the process of writing lyrics, and will be implementing female vocals which will replace the lead melody that begins 22 seconds into the song.</p>
